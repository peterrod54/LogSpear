Windows Log Aggregator & Analyzer

## Description
Typically, there are between 700 and 800 log-file types in any given Windows Server; while some servers contain more log-types depending on installed applications and hardware devices.

The intention here is to introduce a cost effective approach to Windows log management for Small Medium-Sized Businesses (SMB) who, in general, have avoided over-priced log management solutions, i.e. Splunk, LogRythm, et al.
